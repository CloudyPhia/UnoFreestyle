# Uno: Java style

## A virtual uno game coded completely in Java

Uno is a household staple I grew up with and still love to play to this day.
I enjoy both card games and video games, so I thought it would be a fun challenge
to attempt to code a "card video game" in Java as my first project.


This Uno game is for 2-4 players on the same device who want to have some fun! 
During a player's turn, their cards
will be shown, and when it's the next player's turn their cards will be shown.


Here are some general Uno rules:
- Every player starts the round with 7 cards.
- There will be a draw pile. At the start of the game, a card will be picked from this
deck and will begin the discard pile.
- When its your turn, you will choose a card from your hand to discard. It must be either
of the same colour **AND/OR** the same number as the card last played in the discard pile.
- If you cannot play a card, you will have to draw a card from the deck.
- First person to get rid of all of their cards wins!

Have fun and good luck!
