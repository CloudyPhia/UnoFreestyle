# Uno: Java style

## A virtual uno game coded completely in Java

Uno is a household staple I grew up with and still love to play to this day.
I enjoy both card games and video games, so I thought it would be a fun challenge
to attempt to code a "card video game" in Java as my first project.


This Uno game is currently for one player on a single device who want to have some fun! 
During a player's turn, their cards
will be shown, and when it's the next player's turn their cards will be shown.


Here are some general Uno rules:
- Every player starts the round with 7 cards.
- There will be a draw pile. At the start of the game, a card will be picked from this
deck and will begin the discard pile.
- When it's your turn, you can choose to **EITHER** discard a card or draw a card from the deck. 
- If you cannot play a card, you will have to draw a card from the deck.
- First person to get rid of all of their cards wins!

Have fun and good luck!

##User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add cards to my hand by drawing.
- As a user, I want to start with seven randomized cards in my hand.
- As a user, I want to be able to discard specific cards of my choosing. However, if I have no cards left, I 
don't want the ability to discard. 
- As a user, I want to be able to view my list of cards on my turn.

##Future Implementations (coming soon!)
- Multiple player functionality with 2-4 players
- Only discarding cards that are of the same colour and/or number
- Specialty Cards (wild, reverse, + 2, etc.)
- Adding the ability to say "Uno!" when only one card is left
